Here is a collection of research projects I've attempted in my undergrad

### Effect of r/WallStreetBets sentiment on market returns
  - Here I used an existing Natural Language Processing library to analyze forum posts on r/WallStreetBets to analyze its effect on short term investor sentiment on stock market returns

### Effect of cryptocurrencies/tokenization on the economy
  - I'm not sure where to start with this. I want to study how the introduction of crypto changes investor, firm and market interactions
  - I have some ideas but I feel there are a lot of constraints when it comes to collecting data

### Forecasting Bond Prices
  - Economic theory states bond prices are a consequence of supply and demand and that is what drives interest rates.
  - Interested in practicing ML techniques to forecast supply and demand
